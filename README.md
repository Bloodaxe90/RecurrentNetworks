# Recurrent Networks:

This was done after I implemented my Pytorch Transformer as I wanted to go back and have a 
look at the types of networks used for seqential data before transformers.

In this repository I have implemented a RNN, LSTM and GRU and have trained them on the FashionMNIST dataset,

Results can be found in the "Inference" jupyter notebook in the "notebooks" directory

The RNN, LSTM and GRU models were trained on the same data, for the same amount of epochs/batches on the same seed
